<!-- # Density of States Prediction of Crystalline Materials via Prompt-guided Multi-Modal Transformer -->

The offical source code for Density of States Prediction of Crystalline Materials via Prompt-guided Multi-Modal Transformer, accepted at 2023 Neurips main conference.
 
### Overview
The density of states (DOS) is a spectral property of crystalline materials, which provides fundamental insights into various characteristics of the materials. While previous works mainly focus on obtaining high-quality representations of crystalline materials for DOS prediction, we focus on predicting the DOS from the obtained representations by reflecting the nature of DOS: DOS determines the general distribution of states as a function of energy. That is, DOS is not solely determined by the crystalline material but also by the energy levels, which has been neglected in previous works. In this paper, we propose to integrate heterogeneous information obtained from the crystalline materials and the energies via a multimodal transformer, thereby modeling the complex relationships between the atoms in the crystalline materials and various energy levels for DOS prediction. Moreover, we propose to utilize prompts to guide the model to learn the crystal structural system-specific interactions between crystalline materials and energies. Extensive experiments on two types of DOS, i.e., Phonon DOS and Electron DOS, with various real-world scenarios demonstrate the superiority of DOSTransformer.

### Phonon DOS Prediction
#### Dataset
You can dowload phonon dataset in this [repository](https://github.com/ninarina12/phononDoS_tutorial)  

#### Run model
Run `main_phDOS.py` for phonon DOS Prediction after downloading phonon DOS dataset into `data/processed`

### Electron DOS Prediction
#### Dataset
We build Electron DOS dataset consists of the materials and its electron DOS information which are collected from [Materials Proejct](https://materialsproject.org/)  
We converted raw files to `pkl` and made electronic DOS dataset by `mat2graph.py`  

#### Run model
Run `main_eDOS.py` for electron DOS Prediction after building electron DOS dataset.
